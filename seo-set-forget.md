I ocassionally meet small business owners who believe that SEO is like a Hamilton Beach crock pot: you can just "set it and forget it." Sorry, but SEO doesn't work that way. 

You can think of SEO as similar to the stock market. It involves a complex environment with billions of participants and factors, and daily fluctuations. Competition is fierce. This is why SEO requires fastidious, regular action on your part. 

Rankings are hard won, easily lost.  

But disciplined practice can yield amazing results.
