Back in January of 2019 <a href="/copyrighted-images-lawsuits" target="blank">I wrote about</a> how careful you need to be regarding every single image that you use for your business or non-profit. A single slip up — using an image you don't have the legal right to use, or not attributing it exactly as the photographer requested — can get you fined up to $150,000 <em>per image</em>.

The fact that some people take photographs on purpose and place them on websites like Wikimedia Commons in order to lure the clueless into mis-using the photos, is why the term "copyright troll" exists. 

You can compare the troll to the office weirdo who puts chocolate out in an enticing dish, offering it to everyone, then berates them later for eating too much of it. (Yes, this actually happened to someone I know.)

If you're new to the troll racket then take 3 minutes to read <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-28/copyright-law-how-rock-photographer-larry-philpot-perfected-usage-lawsuits" target="blank">this short Bloomberg piece</a>. 

Much of the trolling previously reported on has been done en masse by law firms using technology to trace and identify inappropriate use of images, music, and other content. Target usage may be on websites or in social media. The firms in these cases don't own the content, but do initiate the complaints.

## How to protect yourself from copyright trolls

Do a serious re-think of who has access to post on your website. As <a href="/copyrighted-images-lawsuits" target="blank">I wrote back in 2019</a>: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>How many employees at your non-profit or small business have login credentials for your website and are allowed to publish news, updates, or blog posts? More to the point, how do you decide such matters? . . . </p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>By giving website access to employees (and/or volunteers) before there's a system of checks for image use (and other content liability issues), you’re saying “goodbye” to risk management opportunities. You’re green-lighting a free-for-all and abdicating responsibility for the results.</p></div>

### Understand the landscape

* Educate yourself on the types of images that are available for use, and how you can differentiate between paid-for (and licensed images) and free images which may still come with license restrictions (such as forbidding commercial usage or cropping).  
* Get used to reading the license for any image you intend to use and follow the instructions carefully. 
* Make plan for where you'll get the images you need. For example Unsplash.com features free images that have no restrictions attached. But they're not a source for historical or editorial images. A paid service like Getty Images can be a source of historical images and images of newsmakers like celebrities and politicians. You may also be able to negotiate a contract with Getty to fit your needs. But realize even paid-for images sometimes have specific restrictions on use spelled out in their licenses.
* Create a policy for your organization and put it into writing. Include in this policy who has access to your website. (The fewer the people, the more manageable the risk.)
* Create a strict process for choosing, vetting, and publishing images and ensure staff are trained on it. 
* Look for casual opportunities to remind staff of the importance of the issue: such as sharing online articles about the problem.
