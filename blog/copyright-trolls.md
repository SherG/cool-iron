Back in January of 2019 <a href="/copyrighted-images-lawsuits" target="blank">I wrote about</a> how careful you need to be regarding every single image that you use for your business or non-profit. A single slip up -- using an image you don't have the legal right to use, or not attributing it exactly as the photographer requested -- can get you fined up to $150,000 <em>per image</em>.

The fact that some people take photographs on purpose and place them on websites like Wikimedia Commons in order to lure the clueless into mis-using the photos, is why the term "copyright troll" exists. 

You can compare the troll to the office weirdo who puts chocolate out in an enticing dish, offering it to everyone, then berates them later for eating too much of it. (Yes, this actually happened to someone I know.)

If you're new to this image troll racket then take 3 minutes to read <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-28/copyright-law-how-rock-photographer-larry-philpot-perfected-usage-lawsuits" target="blank">this short Bloomberg piece</a>. 

And then do a serious re-think of who has access to post on your website. As <a href="/copyrighted-images-lawsuits" target="blank">I wrote back in 2019</a>: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>How many employees at your non-profit or small business have login credentials for your website and are allowed to publish news, updates, or blog posts? More to the point, how do you decide such matters? . . . </p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>By giving website access to employees (and/or volunteers) before there's a system of checks for image use (and other content liability issues), you’re saying “goodbye” to risk management opportunities. You’re green-lighting a free-for-all and abdicating responsibility for the results.</p></div>
