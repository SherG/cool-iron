Back when I was performing as a guitarist in South Florida, I sometimes did session work on the side. One night, while playing on South Beach, I was approached by Brazilian singer Iramar and his producer to lay down some tracks on an upcoming album. 

Recorded at <a href="https://www.mixonline.com/recording/ocean-vu-studio-373693" target="blank">Ocean VU Studio</a> in 1995 with Victor Di Persia at the console, the album was released under the title: “<a href="https://immub.org/artista/iramar" target="blank">é fácil complicar</a>.” Translated: “It’s easy to complicate things.”

Sometimes when we feel stuck or frustrated the answer is simple: we need to stop complicating things

Here are some common ways we overcomplicate.

## 1. We expect progress to unfold in a straight line

Sometimes moving forward requires significant changes (such as redesigning a product) or lateral changes, such as pivoting your business to something adjacent. 

As an analogy, consider Mark Egan’s path. In the late 60s, he had already played trumpet professionally before moving to Miami to study at the University’s School of Music.

Egan brought his electric bass with him. He wasn’t nearly as accomplished on that instrument. But soon he was getting calls to do bass gigs. In an interview with <em>Music in the Moment</em> <a href="http://markegan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Review-Mark-Egan-Music-in-the-Moment-July-2014.pdf" target="blank">he explained</a>: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>More and more people called me because I had a good feel. I played one finger bass – and I mean on the fingerboard I really only played with one finger!</p></div>

Demand for Egan’s bass playing grew. After he graduated and moved to New York City, the bass gigs kept coming: a gig with the Pointer Sisters, then with Eumir Deodato, then with David Sanborn, and so on.

This lateral shift unlocked a new future: Mark Egan went from being a trumpeter (and “one-finger” bassist) to being one of the world’s premier jazz bassists.

If you feel stuck in your business, why not explore a pivot to something related?

Consider: 
* Would you rather architect than build? 
* Would you rather teach than manage?
* Do you have strong diagnostic skills but dislike implementing related fixes?
* Do you want to build once, sell twice? (Develop digital recurring revenue.)
* Do you want to investigate, research, or write? 

Start compiling a list of your own thought-joggers. You’ll be surprised at the number of options available to you.

## 2. We’ve forgotten what we’re solving for

Sometimes when we set out to solve a key problem, we can get pulled off course by overthinking. We then wind up trying to solve a cluster of problems at the same time, with the most important one drowned in the mix.

This shows up as the placement of unnecessary hurdles to be cleared before the original problem can be solved.

Because circumstances are such that there is no moving forward with a perfect solution for the problem-cluster, we stay stuck. 

I call this PIC - or problem identification creep. It’s similar to scope creep: a bloating of the work at hand. PIC bars progress and delays results.

* Identifying problems <em>worth solving</em> requires clear thinking. 
* Coming up with solutions and ideas first, before identifying the core problem, creates <em>new</em> problems.

Staying focused on your most important problem(s) is key. Without this clarity, you may rush into action, wasting resources. Busyness may diffuse the psychic burden of a half-assed situation. But that burden will grow.  And we may wind up discounting <a href="https://twitter.com/visualizevalue/status/1279132741032906753" target="blank">persistence</a>.

So what can you do to avoid this scenario?

When the mental clutter starts accumulating, I simply stop and ask myself again: What problem am I trying to solve? 

<hr>

That question brings me back to the main thing, back from the rabbit trails, back from 101 pointless ideas. Everything snaps into focus. My options are clear. A decision follows quickly. The problem is resolved.

Using a <a href="/business-priorities">tool like this one</a> can also help you easily identify problems worth solving. 

Good models can help you structure your thinking  and solve problems constructively.

Some of my favorite marketing models are:

* <a href="/acquisition-behavior-outcomes">Acquisition, Behavior, Outcomes</a>
* <a href="/see-think-do-model">See - Think - Do</a>
* <a href="/dmmm">Digital Measurement and Marketing</a>

Startups might want to consider Strategyzer or Startups.com for models and related online courses.

## 3. Lack of process

Do you have a clear, written process for each major activity?

For example, for your email marketing, do you have clear goals, KPIs, and processes? Or are you randomly sending out “email blasts” when you feel like it?

A process is repeatable and clear. The KPIs provide a reliable measure of results and what needs improving. Improving a process often involves experimentation and small tweaks. 

> Well-chosen KPIs keep you on track, daily closing in your destination. 

Implementing processes is simple. Executing them is a grind, but if the processes are sound, the grind is what produces results. 

Some tough love: if you can’t clearly describe what you’re doing, you don’t know what you’re doing. Writing produces clarity. 

Documenting your processes also makes it easier to onboard new hires. And when it comes time to sell your digital properties, it can make those more valuable.

If you’re a solopreneur you might get away with not writing anything down. Maybe you’ve got it all in your head. But even solopreneurs can benefit from the clarity of written processes.

## 4. Grind, but no think

The daily grinding on processes that work is essential to success. But so is taking time to think about the big picture and monitor KPIs.

I was recently reminded of this in my own work. We tripled the size of one team and I got caught up on the details associated with that, including the new flood of activity. I had to rearrange my schedule to ensure time to focus on the big picture thinking and KPIs at the beginning of each day.

Otherwise it’s too easy to get caught up in thousands of details and miss key opportunities for improvement or to miss indicators that something is slipping.

## 5. Focusing on gut instinct rather than evidence

Data is the only reliable steering system for your business. Knowing how to collect it and sift it; knowing what to ignore and pay attention to; is vital. And don't forget data's twin: experimentation.

While your intuition may open new avenues for creative exploration and testing, it can also be misleading. This is true in small everyday situations as well as in pivotal moments in a business. 

> Do you make decisions based on opinions or evidence?

<strong>Everyday example from my own work</strong>: it was believed that our P-Team (an internal nickname) needed to increase throughput. A bonus system was floated toward that end. The conclusion (and solution) seemed reasonable on the surface. However, a check of data showed they had been regularly increasing throughput, week-over-week. The decision then became clear: while we still planned on implementing a bonus system, we needed to grow P-Team substanitally. We tripled the team's size in order to achieve the desired throughput.

<strong>Pivotal moment example</strong>: This example comes from <a href="https://segment.com/" target="blank">Segment</a>'s journey to find the right product-market fit. Working within the framework of Y Combinator, their first product had failed. They had 6 months of funding left to find a direction.

A team member floated a new idea. "That is literally the worst idea I've ever heard," replied co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/reinpk?lang=en" target="blank">Peter Reinhardt</a>, "I have no idea how you build a business around that." 

In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-vfn97QTr0" target="blank">interview with Y Combinator</a>, Reinhardt recalled:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>So we fought about it all day long - there were four of us - I was the most skeptical, I think. There was literally, like, brutal fighting.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>I went home and I was trying to figure out how to kill the idea. I was awake half the night. Finally figured it out.</p></div>

Reinhardt persuaded his team that they should create a landing page explaining the idea, with a sign-up form, and post it on Hacker News. Reinhardt knew no one would be interested. This seemed to be a good way to kill the idea. Soon everyone could get back to brainstorming.

After posting the landing page however, something unexpected happened. Interest <em>exploded</em>.

Fast-forward to 2020: after 9 years of rapid growth and success, Reinhardt and his co-founders sold Segment to Twilio for $3.2 billion.


## Summing it up

Have you ever turned a molehill into a mountain? Snatched defeat from the jaws of victory? Stubbonly stuck to your path even though it's going in circles? Refused to entertain opposing ideas? 

Overcomplicating things can lead to completely avoidable problems. 

We all do it. But the good news is, while it’s easy to complicate things it’s also easy to stop.
