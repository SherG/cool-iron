I’ve had a personal account on Facebook for well over a decade, but I’ve been inactive on that social media platform for years. During that inactive period I checked in a couple of times but considered my account dormant. I finally exported my photos and pushed the delete button.

Why? I lost interest.

## Nostalgia for the pre-Facebook era

It used to be that if you wanted to socialize there were 2 options: by phone or in person. In person was always the preferred default. Only if your friends or relatives lived far away did you resort to phone calls. 

Cellphones were used primarily for making plans: "Hey Eric, I'm picking up Arminda and we'll meet you guys at Dave & Busters. Are John and Marina coming?"

The more I’ve reminisced about this, the more I’ve questioned the value I get from newsfeed-based social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. 

Reading Cal Newport's <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525542876/" target="blank">Digital Minimalism</a></em>  reinforced my questioning. Interestingly, Newport has never had a social media account. He doesn't spend much time surfing the web either. "As a result, my phone plays a relatively minor role in my life," he notes. (The advent of social media occurred only a few years after the CEO of Ericsson promised to make the cellphone the center of the consumer's universe.)

For me, post-pandemic, I'm looking forward to prioritizing offline socializing.

## Escaping the walled garden

When I last logged in, I noticed Facebook’s user interface (UI) had changed considerably. I didn’t care for the new design, which seemed busier. 

Also, Facebook has become much more of a walled garden: a one-stop shop designed to contain you like a steel ball in a pinball machine. You ping about, setting off 'buzzers' and getting 'rewards' while they collect behavioral data on you to sell to others.

## The warden and the fools

Before formally shutting my account down I caught my first glimpse of Facebook’s “warning” notes: correctives it dutifully pastes like a Victorian schoolmarm onto  comments it deems problematic. These I saw on a friend’s newsfeed, who responded with the humorous epithet: “fascistbook!”

Warning labels stuck like annoying Post-its on casual comments change the mood and atmosphere on the platform. It's not just you and your friends and acquaintances socializing anymore, it's you, them, and a phalanx of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsShZNHmpGE" target="blank">intrusive busybodies</a>. 

### Interventionists and the Lure of the Transgressive

If people’s minds are really so feeble that they need all sorts of assists and crutches just to make their way through what are usually low-definition social media posts, then it’s a problem that Post-it notes aren’t going to fix. Indeed, outsourcing our thinking (and therefore agency) to others is part of the larger, underlying societal fault line. 

And, even if the Post-it note is accurate (and that's a big 'if' given nuanced problems that have ensued), is there any evidence that these notes change people’s minds? Do they perhaps make people <em>more</em> interested in the comment, once it’s labeled &mdash; implicity &mdash; subversive or <em>transgressive</em>?

### Truth and orthodoxy

Also consider:
* Professor <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/jmsb/faculty/gad-saad.html" target="blank">Gad Saad</a> recently had such a warning label appended to a comment of his, because of the page he linked to, which he was <em>criticizing</em>. (Guilt by association.) 
* Similarly, biologist <a href="https://bretweinstein.net/" target="blank">Bret Weinstein</a>, a self-described progressive, had a video interview flagged because his interview subject promotes a controversial and widely rejected theory that the COVID-19 vaccination rollout, timed in the midst of the pandemic, could create escape mutants, making the pandemic far worse. Weinstein did not agree with those concerns but wanted to explore them &mdash; with his audience &mdash; in dialogue. Other entities <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19-critical-thinking-pseudoscience/doomsday-prophecy-dr-geert-vanden-bossche" target="blank">have addressed the theory</a>. Yet Facebook fact-checkers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t7P2i4o53U" target="blank">appended a warning label</a> to this particular exploration. (Original video interview is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNyAovuUxro" target="blank">here</a>.)
* Facebook fact-checker Politifact had to <a href="https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1396581749665140738" target="blank">walk back a previous "Pants on fire" label</a>. What their initial "fact-check" did, it would seem, was encourage viewers to not question the orthodoxy <em>du jour</em>. In doing so, it effectively discounted the views of dozens of scientists who believed the <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/" target="blank">"lab leak" hypothesis</a> was reasonable and deserved exploration. [Those scientists included <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html" target="blank">Philip Murphy</a> — <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/philip-m-murphy-md" target="blank">chief of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology</a> at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).] 

Where precision or nuance in fact-checking and 'intervention' is missing the results are censorship or suppression of speech nonetheless. 

Indeed, taking on the mantle of "fact checker" is a tall order, and requires, among other things, a thorough understanding of related multiple contexts; the nature, current state of, and history of contrarian positions among scientists and academics including in research papers; and ab understanding of game theory and complex systems science. It also requires a precise understanding of what <em>isn't known</em> and therefore can't be "fact-checked." 

And it requires an understanding of the one speaking: of their history, and style of, or propensity for, satire and dry humor, for example. 

The potential to chill speech should be of particular concern to mainstream media, who are neck-deep in Facebook fact-checking. After all, they're well-versed in instances where the government has <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/897/chilling-effect" target="blank">chilled speech</a>.


## Busybodies Push Facebook Into the Strait of Messina

Facebook has an opt-in, opt-out system. That’s the best you can get with marketing. Like it? Join and stay. Don’t like it? Don’t join or leave. 

Facebook became powerful because billions of consumers said “Yes, we like this!” 

Feedback is always important, especially if it's unfiltered and unmarred by "expert re-interpretation" or skewed assumptions. But the need for a political intervention was/is questionable. This is something perpetual busybodies don’t understand. (The world would perhaps be a far kinder, better place if said busybodies attended to ridding themselves of their own hypocrisies and errors in thinking, rather than trying to police others.)  

### Antitrust, Censorship, and Narrative Shaping

Now, I’ve criticized this “Post-it” note system for its flaws and for the lack of evidence that it produces a needed benefit, but my contention is it’s not designed to work in the way you expect. It’s partly a price extracted by the political busybodies who’ve pushed the social media giant between the Scylla of <a href="https://newsfilter.io/articles/why-facebook-and-google-face-the-most-risk-in-an-overhaul-of-antitrust-law-c2c1d6a16a2bd9a9cb0125e2f4f9e1c7" target="blank">antitrust action</a> (right and left) and the Charybdis of “Make people stop saying stupid things and things we find abhorrent!” (on the left).

Facebook has struck a bargain with Charybdis which may not save it from rocky crags of Scylla. And then there's the threatened revocation of Section 230 (<a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/10/committee-to-hold-hearing-with-big-tech-ceos-on-section-230" target="blank">on the right</a>) as well.

In the meantime, unfortunately, we'll be treated to the continuing spectacle of politicians on the right and left grilling Zuckerberg in public Kabuki theater, and fighting for greater control of Facebook. 

The signs of this political struggle are strewn across Facebook's newsfeeds.


## In Sum

Mr. Zuckerberg, thanks for all the good times. I've had a lot of laughs and fun on Facebook, sharing photos and humor. I've played games and been entertained. I've enjoyed seeing my friends' updates and having conversations as well as learning things from my brainy friends' Facebook Notes. But this is not the best use of my time.

Besides, conversation fails to feel natural (or appealing) knowing every word you're typing is being watched and weighed, as a bureaucratic functionary or its algorithmic stand-in decide whether your ideas warrant warning labels, suppression, and social disapproval.

No thanks.

### Why discuss this on SignalFox? 

Given this was my personal Facebook account, you may be wondering why I chose to publish this post on a business website. I've been reading and encountering in conversations, (1) greater pushback among business owners against the idea that Facebook is important or even useful to business, and (2) a trend - albeit unmeasured - of disillusioned individuals leaving Facebook. 

I'm interested in whether these phenomena will develop into a significant trend. I'm also interested in what unintended consequences may ensue from the fact-checking program. For that reason, I'll continue to share related information here that I believe our readers will find of interest. And I'll have more to say soon about controversies surrounding Facebook.

Facebook advertising continues to be a powerful way to <a href="/see-think-do-model">boost initial awareness</a> for a brand, and to entice people to begin learning about your business. But YouTube (with its long-form podcasts and videos) and your website are two of the best platforms for fostering in-depth exploration.
