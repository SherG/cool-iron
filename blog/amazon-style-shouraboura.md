In a previous blog post we highlighted the striking similarities between Amazon's department store concept ("leaked" to the Wall St. Journal) and the bot-powered store design <a href="/amazon-department-stores">launched a decade ago</a> by engineer-entrepreneurs Nadia Shouraboura and Caroline Shouraboura.

In a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-reimagines-in-store-shopping-with-amazon-style" target="blank">blog post</a> published today, Amazon elaborates on their soon-to-launch physical apparel store -- called Amazon Style -- and the similarities are even more striking.

Here's an overview of similarities with Hointer:

* Creative use of QR codes paired to in-store shopping app to (a) Find alternative style recommendations and reviews and (b) Tap to have items automatically delivered to fitting room
* Interactive screens in fitting rooms to request auto-delivery of different sizes, call for a stylist, or view related recommendations.
* Use of single display items rather than racks and shelves of clothing. Inventory is kept off-floor and delivered directly to fitting rooms via micro-robotics. (Amazon says delivery is via "advanced technologies and processes used in Amazon fulfillment centers.")
* Use of the above to develop stores with small footprints and labor requirements and better customer experience
* Touchless self-checkout (Hointer used an app, Amazon Style will use palm-based biometrics.)

Hointer opened flagship stores which served as test-beds -- they had coders on the floor reacting to shoppers' feedback and altering things on the go. But they also functioned as a technology company, much in the same way that Ocado does or that Amazon does with their cloud services: making their innovative tech available to other businesses.

Hointer's bot-powered system <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/10/are-you-really-innovating-around-your-customers-needs" target="blank">solved</a> real customer pain points. This is in contrast to retailers' gimmicky use of tech to do pointless things. Ever click on a QR code in a store only to be led to a dead-end web page that contains the same info as posters in the store? 

Hointer was acquired by the Australian firm Wesfarmers. While some big US retailers trialed Hointer tech it's not clear that it ever caught on here. 

In retrospect, it seems the Shourabouras were a decade ahead of everyone else -- including Amazon. If Amazon's deployment of this same approach takes off, it'll be a bitter pill for retailers who dithered for a decade when offered a concept sold as a competitive advanatage against Amazon.
