I use Github fairly often, but rarely make pull requests. When I go to create a new one, I find I need a refresher on how to do it. 

So I decided to create this short cheatsheet for myself.  Perhaps you'll find it helpful as well. 

## What is a pull request? 

A pull request is a technique for suggesting edits to someone's code base. Like the "review suggested edits" feature in Google Docs, a pull request provides the code repository owner with an easy way to review your suggested edits and incorporate them into their code if they wish.

### Reasons for making pull requests 

Some reasons for making pull requests include: 

* You're a newbie coder and are looking to contribute to existing projects
* You noticed an error and would like to propose a fix
* You'd like to solve an existing problem discussed in an Issues thread on the repository.
* You'd like to propose an improvement: such as a more efficient way of executing a task. 

## How do you create a pull request? 

1. Fork the original repository. (You have no access to that person's code base. So you need a copy of it that you can control.)
2. In the forked copy, navigate to the page where you noticed an error.

In the example above, I nagivated to the /layouts/partials/categories.html page. I want to remove the brackets highlighted in yellow. 

3. Click the edit button, edit the code, then save. 

4. Click on "Pull requests" near top left

5. Now you'll see your code suggestion (highlighted in green) below the original code (highlighted in red). Check to make sure your code is correct. Then click the green "Pull request" button at upper right.

You'll have a space to briefly explain your proposed change.

The code repository owner will be notified. Once he reviews your code suggestion, and acts on it, you'll be notified. 

Fun fact: if your code suggestion is accepted, you are now a contributor to their code project. Your contribution will be documented on their page and your profile photo will appear as a contributor.
