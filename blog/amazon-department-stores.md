Today's <em>Wall St. Journal</em> featured an "exclusive" article leaking Amazon plans to trial high-tech brick-and-mortar clothing stores. The headline: "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-amazons-department-store-plans-high-tech-dressing-rooms-its-own-apparel-brands-11632303002" target="blank">Inside Amazon’s Department Store Plans: High-Tech Dressing Rooms, Its Own Apparel Brands</a>." 

Amazon's stores could feature "QR codes," "touch screens," and "a non-traditional shopping experience" the <em>Journal</em> reports.

## Back to the future 

I felt I had been whooshed back to 9 years ago. The insider leaks seemed to be describing Hointer: a retail concept and set of technologies developed by <em>former</em> Amazon exec <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiashouraboura/" target="blank">Nadia Shouraboura</a>. The Hointer experience was trialed in pilot stores, including a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2012/hointer-robot-jeans-clothing-apparel-store-startup/" target="blank">mens's store</a> in Seattle's U district.

Shoppers could use her proprietary app to capture QR codes. Tap the app and the items were automatically sent to a high-tech dressing room. Need a different size? Tap the touch screen in the fitting room and the clothing item would instantly appear before you, thanks to micro-robotics. No running after the salesperson or going in-and-out of the dressing room to hunt down what you needed. 

Tap another button and have a knowledgeable stylist come to consult with you on a different look. And forget the checkout line. You paid on your way out with a wave of your phone. 

Interestingly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_G8m4FLk6g" target="blank">her model</a>, a problem-solving fusion of the tactile and digital, would limit face-to-face interaction in today's pandemic-aware world.

The Hointer vision was captured in this charming video that Shouraboura filmed with her daughter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-shouraboura-527a9693/" target="blank">Caroline</a>:

Let's go back to the <em>Wall St. Journal</em> article, which provides details leaked by the insiders: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>One idea that has been tested is for customers to scan QR codes of items they want to try on by using a smartphone app . . . </a></divp

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>Once there [in the fitting room], customers could ask for more items using a touch screen, which might be capable of recommending additional clothing based on the pieces shoppers liked.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>. . .  Robots or other forms of automation could eventually be deployed in the stores, one of the people said.</p></div>

The article continues: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>The online shopping company has made an effort to keep its clothing concept secret, giving it a code name. </p></div>

## Code name: Shouraboura!

I know the code name: "Shouraboura!" Or maybe "Mayday!" (That's an insider joke Shouraboura would appreciate.) 

Seriously, the leakers aren't describing anything fundamentally different than Hointer, so they may as well have code-named the project: Shouraboura. 

There are some odd, pedestrian details included in the leak. After customers scan QR codes, "then associates in the store" would "gather the items and place them in fitting rooms." Come on. People have been doing that since the 1800s. It seems certain Amazon will use something similar to Shouraboura's automated delivery system.

Remember that qualifier:

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>Robots or other forms of automation could eventually be deployed in the stores, one of the people said.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>The plans aren’t completed and could change, they said.</p></div>

You don't say!

Is Shouraboura is involved in this project? Perhaps Amazon bought her intellectual property and tech. 

If not, maybe they should consider it. Amazon has an invaluable assets in their recommendation engine and massive customer purchase histories. But Shouraboura has already bridged the digital and physical retail space successfully, using her proprietary mix of mobile tech, IoT, and robotics to solve key customer problems and unlock new value.

One thing's for sure: everything described in the article was done a decade ago. 

And since then Shouraboura has deployed her concepts to successfully transform shopping experiences at Macy's and other top retailers.
