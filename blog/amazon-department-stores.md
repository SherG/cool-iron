Today's <em>Wall St. Journal</em> featured an "exclusive" article leaking Amazon plans to trial high-tech brick-and-mortar clothing stores. The headline: "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-amazons-department-store-plans-high-tech-dressing-rooms-its-own-apparel-brands-11632303002" target="blank">Inside Amazon’s Department Store Plans: High-Tech Dressing Rooms, Its Own Apparel Brands</a>." 

Amazon's stores could feature "QR codes," "touch screens," and "a non-traditional shopping experience" the <em>Journal</em> reports.

## Back to the future 

I felt I had been whooshed back to 9 years ago. The insider leaks seemed to be describing Hointer: a retail concept and set of technologies developed by <em>former</em> Amazon exec <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiashouraboura/" target="blank">Nadia Shouraboura</a>. The Hointer experience was trialed in pilot stores, including a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2012/hointer-robot-jeans-clothing-apparel-store-startup/" target="blank">mens's store</a> in Seattle's U district.

Shoppers could use her proprietary app to capture QR codes and view matching items. Tap the app and the items were automatically sent to a high-tech dressing room. Need a different size? Tap the touch screen in the fitting room and the clothing item would instantly appear before you, thanks to micro-robotics. No running after the salesperson or going in-and-out of the dressing room to hunt down what you needed. 

Tap another button and have a knowledgeable stylist come to consult with you on a different look. 

And forget the checkout line. You paid on your way out with a wave of your phone. 

Hointer's beta stores functioned as testbeds and proof-of-concept. So it's not surprising that they were used to attract <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/how-macys-and-technology-fit-well-together/" target="blank">retailers</a> like Macy's who wanted to deploy and test the tech in their own stores.

Interestingly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_G8m4FLk6g" target="blank">her model</a>, a problem-solving fusion of the tactile and digital, would limit face-to-face interaction in today's pandemic-aware world.

The Hointer vision was captured in this charming video that Shouraboura filmed with her daughter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-shouraboura-527a9693/" target="blank">Caroline</a>:

Let's go back to the <em>Wall St. Journal</em> article, which provides details leaked by the insiders: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>One idea that has been tested is for customers to scan QR codes of items they want to try on by using a smartphone app . . . </a></divp

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>Once there [in the fitting room], customers could ask for more items using a touch screen, which might be capable of recommending additional clothing based on the pieces shoppers liked.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>. . .  Robots or other forms of automation could eventually be deployed in the stores, one of the people said.</p></div>

The article continues: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>The online shopping company has made an effort to keep its clothing concept secret, giving it a code name. </p></div>

I know the code name: "Shouraboura!" Or maybe "Mayday!" (That's an insider joke Shouraboura would appreciate.) 

Seriously, the leakers aren't describing anything fundamentally different than Hointer, so they may as well have code-named the project "Shouraboura."

There are some odd, pedestrian details included in the leak. After customers scan QR codes, "associates in the store" will "gather the items and place them in fitting rooms." Come on. Salespeople hand-carrying garments to fitting rooms has been done since when — the 1800s? Amazon's not going to do that. They'll likely create something similar to Shouraboura's automated delivery system.

Remember that qualifier:

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>Robots or other forms of automation could eventually be deployed in the stores, one of the people said.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>The plans aren’t completed and could change, they said.</p></div>

You don't say!

Is Shouraboura is involved in this project? Perhaps Amazon bought her intellectual property and tech. 

If not, maybe they should consider it. 

* Amazon's recommendation engine, massive customer data trove, Alexa tech, and continual testing regimen are invaluable assets. 
* Meanwhile, Shouraboura has already identified, reverse-engineered, and solved some key, related customer problems using a proprietary mix of mobile tech, IoT, and micro-robotics.

It'll be interesting to see what comes of Amazon's new experiments.

One thing's for sure: everything described in the article was in place a decade ago. So we'll have to wait to hear what's truly innovative about Amazon's plan.

  <summary>More on Hointer and high-tech retail experiments</summary>
<p> The retail chessboard’s about to get more interesting with Amazon’s play. Some questions and observations:</p>

* How many retailers trialed Hointer’s tech or kept using it? What were their findings? 
* Ironically, Hointer was at one point described as conferring a potential competitive advantage over Amazon.
* Ditching a QR-reading app has appeal. Why be distracted with having to download an app and keep your potentially large cell or phablet in your hand while interacting with merch, especially clothing, which you'll want to touch with both hands? Old-school push-buttons, hand movements, or voice commands could also be used to select and send apparel to fitting rooms.
* Experiments with AR, VR, and QR codes as well as touchscreens in dressing rooms have a long history now. And there's plenty to learn from successes. For example, when Rebecca Minkoff launched interactive mirrors, they helped contribute to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/09/how-rebecca-minkoff-uses-tech-to-drive-triple-digit-sales-growth.html" target="blank">tripling of sales</a>. 
* When omni-channel meets Amazon's customer data, in-store (and on Prime) personalization will acquire new dimensions. Think: 1:1 lookbooks, seamless recommendations that span the physical and digital, and your favorite music automatically streaming in the dressing room. 
* First-party data will likely remain a priority for bricks.
* Amazon is now the <a href="https://www.campaignlive.com/article/amazon-biggest-advertiser-earth-adspend-hits-11bn/1672723" target="blank">world’s biggest advertiser</a>. Add that to the mix and bricks are facing quite an intriguing challenge.</p>
