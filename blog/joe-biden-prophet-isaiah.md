Following the attacks on Hamid Karzai International Airport, President Biden addressed the nation in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-terror-attack-at-hamid-karzai-international-airport/" target="blank">speech</a> that, surprisingly, quoted from the Book of Isaiah.

Here's that passage: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, “Whom shall I send . . . who shall go for us?”  And the American military has been answering for a long time: “Here am I, Lord.  Send me.”  “Here I am.  Send me.”</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>Each one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm’s way, to risk everything — not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em;><p>And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform — military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion.</p></div>

The Book of Isaiah is a major prophetic book that spans several themes. One of the main themes is God's judgment on his own people. It's filled with bone-chilling predictions of divine punishment, including on their military. For example, in Chapter 3, verse 25 we read: "Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle." 

This is one reason why the choice of Isaiah is bizarre: the prophet foretold the destruction of his own nation's military at the hand of a foreign power. 

Not exactly reassuring words to use in a presidential speech.

American Presidents have often used biblical allusions in their speeches -- such as "city on a hill." While phrases and passages from the Bible can sound familiar, poetic, or inspiring, stripping them of all context makes them meaningless and can cause confusion or appear manipulative. 

Presidents — and their speechwriters — should instead speak plainly. Say what you mean. And be wary of invoking scripture.
