Following the attacks on Hamid Karzai International Airport, President Biden addressed the nation in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-terror-attack-at-hamid-karzai-international-airport/" target="blank">speech</a> that, surprisingly, quoted from the Book of Isaiah.

Here's that passage: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em"><p>Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, “Whom shall I send . . . who shall go for us?”  And the American military has been answering for a long time: “Here am I, Lord.  Send me.”  “Here I am.  Send me.”</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em"><p>Each one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm’s way, to risk everything — not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em"><p>And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform — military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion.</p></div>

## A bizarre choice

The Isaiah quote is an odd choice. In the Book of Isaiah, the phrase "Here am I, Lord. Send me" is not spoken by a warrior volunteering for military service. It's spoken by Isaiah volunteering to deliver God's messages.

What kind of messages? One of the main themes of the Book of Isaiah is God's judgment on his own people. Chapters are filled with warnings of divine punishment, including against the military. For example, one of the <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/isaiah/3" target="blank">messages</a> is: "Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle." 

So, the prophet who said “Here am I, Lord. Send me." foretold the destruction of his own nation's military at the hand of a foreign power.

## Propaganda and persuasion

American Presidents have often used biblical allusions in their speeches — such as "city on a hill." These allusions, more often than not it would seem — at least in the modern era — are used as expressions of political propaganda and persuasion.

It's also traditional for Presidents to invoke the Bible at times of national crises or tragedies. One reason may be because biblical passages often sound ennobling, lofty, and solemn. The <em>tone</em> of the passage may appear to fit the audience response that the speechwriter desires to invoke.

However, by using such phrases entirely out of context the communication becomes meaningless.

Presidents — and their speechwriters — should instead speak plainly. Say what you mean. And be wary of invoking the Bible.
