Following the attacks on Hamid Karzai International Airport, President Biden addressed the nation in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-terror-attack-at-hamid-karzai-international-airport/" target="blank">speech</a> that, surprisingly, quoted from the Book of Isaiah.

Here's that passage: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em"><p>Those who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, “Whom shall I send . . . who shall go for us?”  And the American military has been answering for a long time: “Here am I, Lord.  Send me.”  “Here I am.  Send me.”</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em"><p>Each one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm’s way, to risk everything — not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.3em"><p>And I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform — military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion.</p></div>


In the Book of Isaiah, the phrase "Here am I, Lord. Send me" is not a warrior volunteering for military service. It's Isaiah volunteering to deliver God's messages as a prophet.

One of the main themes of the Book of Isaiah is God's judgment on his own people. It's filled with bone-chilling predictions of divine punishment, including on the military. For example, in Chapter 3, <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/isaiah/3" target="blank">verse 25</a> we read: "Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle." 

American Presidents have often used biblical allusions in their speeches — such as "city on a hill." These allusions, more often than not it would seem, are used as expressions of political propaganda and persuasion.

While phrases and passages from the Bible can sound familiar, poetic, or inspiring, stripping them of all context makes them meaningless. Worse, such communications can cause confusion or appear manipulative. 

Presidents — and their speechwriters — should instead speak plainly. Say what you mean. And be wary of invoking scripture.
