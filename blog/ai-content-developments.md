At the end of 2022 I <a href="https://www.signalfox.org/chatgpt-google-code-red">wrote</a> that the story that ChatGPT was a "Code Red" for Google's search business, seemed overwrought.

After all, "Google could choose to develop an advanced version of ChatGPT, offer it as a search interface option, and monetize it."

That's exactly what they did in May 2023, announcing the new SGE (Search Generative Experience) at the annual Google I/O conference. 

In the process they also provided the first major change to Google Search's visual interface in many years, not counting the continual evolution of layout features. That secondary effect was a good idea. ChatGPT's interface was sleek and evoked proximity and one-on-one conversation. By comparison, Google Search began to seem a bit stale.

In February of this year Bing rushed to incorporate ChatGPT in <em>its</em> search interface.

## ChatGPT 4 and the Plugin Marketplace

Since then we've seen the release of GPT-4 and the marketplace of ChatGPT plugins that extend the chatbot's functionality. 

You have to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) to gain access to the marketplace. We've tried out plenty of the content/marketing plugins. In our view, they're nearly all (except for maybe 1 or 2) disappointing and useless. 

We found one that does a good job of creating social media blurbs if you feed it a prompt like this: 
"Create a short social media blurb to promote an article about (topic)."  It will return a lively blurb with relevant emojis and hashtags. 

But if you <em>refine</em> your prompt ("add relevant emojis and hashtags"), and skip the plugin, you'll get the same result.

In other words, some of these plugins seem to have simply crafted good prompts which get triggered by keywords like "social media blurb." 
  
We liked the apps that will summarize PDFs. But <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="blank">Anthropic's Claude</a> does a stellar job at this and it's free. So why pay $20/month?

Lastly we found a ChatGPT app that did an excellent job summarizing a video, then it proceeded to hallucinate repeatedly. A few weeks later we tried it again and got several error messages.

There are also apps that will create diagrams and charts. But why? The results are ugly and low-res. You can get better charts for free from Excel or Google Sheets or from any number of low-cost solutions like Canva. In addition, interactive data visualization tools, like Tableau, have been on the market for years. 

The ChatGPT marketplace seems immature, as would be expected at this stage. In some ways, it's reminiscent of the Alexa Skills marketplace, which quickly filled up with clever apps that no one needed.

<em>Note: ChatGPT Plus users get access to ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4. The latter is slow, understandably, because it's used for more advanced calculations or has to interface with plugins. (Plugins can only be used with GPT4.)</em>

ChatGPT is a powerful tool, but we'll take a pass on the marketing plugins.

AI has been used in marketing for decades now. To find good uses for the new crop of <em>generative</em> AI tools, you'll need to dive beneath the surface chatter.

## AI in Marketing

For starters, there are plenty of opportunities to deploy LLMs in video translation, communications, analytics, categorization and summaries of documents and files.

Here are some examples. 

* Synchronicity Labs has used ChatGPT and other technologies to deliver what seems to be a superior <a href="https://twitter.com/therealprady/status/1680645510103977987">video translation product</a> (in closed beta). 
* Those with massive document troves to summarize will want to check out <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="blank">Anthropic's Claude</a>. This tool can also be used to summarize PDFs, which can save research time. (Rather than reading 50+ pages a researcher can get a succinct and accurate summary and decide whether to read the entire document.)
* We've been impressed with <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/playground/source" target="blank">Assembly.ai's pristine transcripts</a> of video and audio files.
* <a href="https://fireflies.ai/" target="blank">Fireflies.ai</a> records and transcribes meetings, organizing content by sections and filters like "Questions" and "Tasks." Fireflies will auto-generate action items. And you can voice-trigger tasks to be set up in project management platforms like Trello or Asana. Fireflies can also send out summaries and log call notes under related contacts in a CRM. Interestingly, some business users indicate Fireflies, by improving communication, is shortening their sales pipeline.

There are plenty of ways to improve performance and gain efficiencies in customer support with new AI capabilities too. 

AI in general will continue to make it possible to refine processes in new ways, increase automation, and build resilience against unexpected factors. 

## Revisiting the Hype 

As we mentioned in our last article, the hype surrounding ChatGPT's release was intense. This was particularly notable in content/marketing applications. Social media was filled with influencers claiming you could get rich quick by having AI write all your articles and video scripts.

Prominent SEO pros reacted to ChatGPT with gloomy warnings on the future of the profession.

SEO specialists amplified the mania by writing endless articles cataloging everything ChatGPT could do. For example, it could generate sitemaps, robots.txt files, and schema markup. Yes, but who does that by hand anymore anyway? For years we've had tools that could not only generate schema but insert the code in exactly the right place with zero errors. 

Next, top SEO publications heralded every marketing/SEO app in the ChatGPT marketplace. That's a clever tactic for ranking high for "ChatGPT apps" but these advertorials have low information value.

Google software engineer and AI researcher <a href="https://fchollet.com/" target="blank">Fran√ßois Chollet</a> put it well when he <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1689114236453339136" target="blank">xeeted</a>: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Every 6 months the tech industry enters a brief episode of mass collective hallucination where everyone is ardently convinced that an epochal tech revolution has just begun, that a "civilizational" technology is starting to take over. Remember web3? Remember LK-99? Remember LLMs?</p></div>

When asked whether he thought LLMs were <em>not</em> transformative, Chollet <a href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1689131305014087680" target="blank">replied</a>: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>LLMs are fine, but they aren't anywhere within 100 light years of what they were touted to be by your average tech industry NPC (a civilizational technology, the beginning of AGI, about to automate all jobs, obsoleting software engineering, etc.). It would be like saying "the metaverse hype was legit because there's a niche market for VR headsets to play games". None of what was forecasted actually happened.</p></div>
