Will ChatGPT set off an earthquake that swallows Google? Unlikely, despite a "gee whiz" article making the rounds.

_The New York Times_ claims that when ChatGPT was released, Google management <a href="https://archive.ph/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html" target="blank">declared a "Code Red</a>" which was "akin to pulling the fire alarm." This is according to anonymous sources. 

The _Times_ also said they viewed a "memo" and listened to an "audio recordings" of a Google meeting, but they didn't publish these items. So readers can't assess these things for themselves.

The article quickly brings in the proverbial "_Some fear_ . . .".

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Some fear the company may be approaching a moment that the biggest Silicon Valley outfits dread — the arrival of an enormous technological change that could upend the business.</p></div>

But only a few paragaphs into the story we read that "the technology at the heart of OpenAI’s chat bot was developed by researchers at Google." (This is a reference to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/01/lamda-towards-safe-grounded-and-high.html" target="blank">LaMDA</a>.) So it's hard to believe the search giant was flailing about, blindsided.

"Code Red" and "alarm" along with a few "experts" offering warnings, make for a sexy story. But is that drama inherent in the story?

The authors suggest that this technology could "cannibalize" Google's "lucrative search ads."

## Engaging and Conversational

ChatGPT is engaging and fast. The sleek interface evokes proximity and emulates one-on-one conversation. Before you know it, you'll be adding niceties to your interactions, like "Merry Christmas, ChatGPT."

"Assistant," as ChatGPT prefers to be called, seems confident and produces well-formed sentences and paragraphs, even when its answers include errors.<sup><a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup> It can correct itself and refine its answers in dialogue. 

People have been sharing creative ways to use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and as a productivity tool. These areas seem particularly promising. 

For example, it can generate ideas, statistics, comparisons, sentiment analysis, and code for you. To grasp the potential, explore the use of ChatGPT prompts. 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672556183/SignalFox/chatgpt-json-file_j8nymj.png" />

Unlike Google Search, you don't need to sift through results to find a suitable answer. The bot just delivers one answer, saving you time. It's easy to see the appeal especially for simple questions. (See <a href="https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/googles-existential-threat-chatgpt-matches-googles-performance-on-informational-search-queries-and-smashes-it-on-coding" target="blank">this</a>.)

But ChatGPT doesn't _index_ content or crawl the web. It's not a search engine. It has a different mission than Google Search, and is at the opposite end of the maturity scale. So the idea of it demolishing Google's ad revenue seems fanciful.

## A new Google Search interface?

Also, Google could choose to develop an advanced version of ChatGPT, offer it as a search interface option, and monetize it. 

When you sign up for OpenAI.com (in order to use ChatGPT) you can sign in with your Gmail account. That's one avenue to monetization: capture identity (assign a unique identifier to each user) and couple it to queries. 

And there's nothing preventing a service like ChatGPT from posting ads on its pages. 

### . . . ChatGPT can already deliver results inside Google 

This <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-for-google/jgjaeacdkonaoafenlfkkkmbaopkbilf" target="blank">ChatGPT for Google</a> Chrome extension causes ChatGPT's answer to your search queries to _appear directly in Google search results_, in the right-hand margin. 

The developer's example (a search for "how to create blink animations in CSS") provides a good example of ChatGPT at its best. The chatbot immediately delivers actual code to copy-paste, while Google's results are topped with a featured snippet and the search engine's reminder of just how many results it has for you: "About 1,360,000 results."

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672596024/SignalFox/chatgpt-in-serp_stozkv.png" />

A search for "ski packages in Vermont" generated a long list of ads at the top of Google, compared to the ad-free ChatGPT response. In some cases users may prefer ad-free recommendations, but ChatGPT didn't provide any hyperlinks or contact information. That's not very helpful.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672599194/SignalFox/google-serp-vs-chatgpt_gy7ww1.png" />

It's easy to cherry-pick ChatGPT wins (or potential wins). You're still stuck with lots of _non_-results.

## ChatGPT vs Google Search

In comparing ChatGPT with Google, it's worth noting what the former doesn't do.

### Sorry, no internet access

For example, ChatGPT can't currently access the internet to retrieve information. And it doesn't seem to provide users with clickable references or sources unless you ask it to.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672553573/SignalFox/chatgpt-links-to-sources_uymkz0.png" />

In this, it differs from the OpenAI-search engine hybrid <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/" target="blank">Perplexity.ai</a>, which includes clickable footnotes and citations with all answers.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672454812/SignalFox/perplexity-ai_is865c.png" />

Also consider that countless queries are made on Google Search for _up-to-date_ stock prices, tickets, event times, train and flight schedules, traffic delays, products, and more. 

### What search intent?

ChatGPT struggles to understand and satisfy _**search intent**_. This Google search for "<strong>lambskin bomber jackets</strong>" yields helpful ads plus buttons at the top for "men's," women's," "genuine leather," "faux fur" and so on. 

Google understand the search intent is _shopping_. ChatGPT just spits out a description of what a lambskin bomber jacket is. (Note: The ChatGPT Chrome extension interferes with the display of jackets, and is partially cut off.)

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672600341/SignalFox/google-serp-vs-chatgpt-shopping_sr8b61.png" />

Here's an example of ChatGPT failing to recognize the commercial intent of a search term: "<strong>quotes for building a deck</strong>." Contrast its answer with Google's top results. 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672601164/SignalFox/chatgpt-search-intent-deck-cost_g9d6ma.png" />

### Accuracy and Quality

Google continuously improves the quality of search results. It's done breakthrough work on identifying quality content and accuracy. In contrast, Twitter's now filled with humorous ChatGPT fails. 

Indeed, <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned" target="blank">Stackoverflow banned ChatGPT</a> over concerns that users would flood the site with faulty code, a form of "<a href="https://twitter.com/jdwalters85/status/1608661137738063874" target="blank">confident B.S.</a>".

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking or looking for correct answers.</p></div>

## Other limitations

Development of schema and structured data has given us interactive search results like these. (They look like ads but they're not.) Hover over a jacket and you'll get 5 images that fade in and out, showing multiple angles. 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/f_auto/v1672430369/SignalFox/lambskin-bomber-jacket_af9b7s.png" />

But ChatGPT can't answer queries like this: 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/f_auto/v1672431118/SignalFox/chatgpt-prices-ratings_obyx7r.png" />

Or like this: 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/icecloud7/image/upload/v1672430632/SignalFox/chatgpt-limitations_oocptj.png" />

It also doesn't proactively make suggestions: it waits for you to ask a question.

This is in contast to Google Search which through auto-suggest and personalized search results, is always making recommendations based on your interactions with it.

And how likely is it that people will suddenly want text only and lose their interest in browsing video, audio, and images?

## "a misleading impression of greatness"

The point isn't that ChatGPT should be more like Google. It's to underscore the fact that both products function differently and serve different purposes, although there is overlap, as in providing encyclopedia-style facts and answering progamming questions.

<a href="https://research.google/people/107923/" target="blank">Zoubin Ghahramani</a>, leader of <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/" target="blank">Google Brain</a>, put it well when he told the _Times_ last month: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>A cool demo of a conversational system that people can interact with over a few rounds, and it feels mind-blowing? That is a good step, but it is not the thing that will really transform society.</p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>It is not something that people can use reliably on a daily basis.</p></div>

AI researcher Gary Marcus notes that ChatGPT's CEO admitted as much when he <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1601731295792414720?s=20&t=pM3JTMZ-D8-Qw5q-TXsA8w" target="blank">tweeted</a>:

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>ChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness.</p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>It's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.</p></div>

## "turbocharged pastiche generator"

Marcus predicts that the release of GPT4 next year will be mind-blowing and yet, because its design is fundamentally flawed, it will  "remain a <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting" target="blank">turbocharged pastiche generator</a>."

And that brings us to an uncomfortable possibility. Perhaps one reason why ChatGPT's current performance is over-estimated is because, in some ways, it's essentially mimicking our own propensity to generate and <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/" target="blank">reward confident B.S.</a>

## About that 'Code Red' . . . 

The _Times_ article seems speculative at best. Nevertheless, some SEO professionals are playing up the 'Code Red threat' in their social media comments.

For fun, let's give the robot the last word.
