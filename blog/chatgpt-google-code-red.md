Will ChatGPT set off an earthquake that swallows Google? Unlikely, despite a "gee whiz" article making the rounds.

_The New York Times_ claims that when ChatGPT was released, Google management <a href="https://archive.ph/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html" target="blank">declared a "Code Red</a>" which was "akin to pulling the fire alarm." This is according to anonymous sources. 

The _Times_ also said they viewed a "memo" and listened to an "audio recordings" of a Google meeting, but they didn't publish these items. So readers can't assess these items for themselves.

The article quickly brings in the proverbial "some."

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>Some fear the company may be approaching a moment that the biggest Silicon Valley outfits dread — the arrival of an enormous technological change that could upend the business.</p></div>

But only a few paragaphs into the story we read that "the technology at the heart of OpenAI’s chat bot was developed by researchers at Google." So it's hard to believe the search giant was blindsided.

"Code Red" and "alarm" along with a few "experts" offering warnings, make for a sexy story. But I'm unconvined the drama is _inherent_ in the story, versus ginned up.

The authors suggest that this tech could "cannibalize" Google's "lucrative search ads."

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>If a chat bot is responding to queries with tight sentences, there is less reason for people to click on advertising links.</p></div>

ChatGPT is engaging and fast. "Assistant," (as ChatGPT prefers to be called) is confident and produces well-formed sentences and paragraphs, even when it's partially wrong. 

But ChatGPT doesn't _index_ content. It has a radically different mission from Google, and for that reason the idea of it drawing away Google's ad revenue seems fanciful. 

Also, Google can easily create and launch their own version of ChatGPT and offer it as a search interface option. And it would be easy to monetize. 

Consider for starters, that when you sign up for OpenAI.com (in order to use ChatGPT) you can sign in with your Gmail account. That's one avenue to monetization: capturing identity and coupling it to queries. 

And there's nothing preventing a service like ChatGPT from posting ads on its pages. 

For now, ChatGPT doesn't cite its sources and doesn't provide hyperlinks to users so they can verfy information for themselves. It also doesn't proactively make suggestions: it waits for you to ask a question.

This is in contast to Google Search which through auto-suggest and personalized search results, is always making recommendations based on your interactions with it.

<a href="https://research.google/people/107923/" target="blank">Zoubin Ghahramani</a>, leader of the A.I. lab Google Brain, put it well when he told the Times last month: 

<div style="padding-left: 2.5em;"><p>A cool demo of a conversational system that people can interact with over a few rounds, and it feels mind-blowing? That is a good step, but it is not the thing that will really transform society. It is not something that people can use reliably on a daily basis.</p></div>

Based on anonymous sources, invisible documents and secret recordings (which readers are not allowed to access), the _Times_ story seems on a par with low-level speculative entertainment. 

For that reason it's surprising to see some search engine professionals talking up the 'threat' in social media.
