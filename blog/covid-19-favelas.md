Language instructor Vlad Souza from <a href="http://tropicalportuguese.com/" target="blank">TropicalPortuguese.com</a> has created a <a href="https://tropicalportuguese.teachable.com/p/mini-course-sound-like-brazilians" target="blanks">100% free Portuguese course</a> to help feed Brazilians living in the favelas. 

Residents of the favelas are among those hardest hit by COVID-19.

* Many of them lack running water, which makes basic sanitation and hygiene impossible.
* Crowded conditions make social distancing impossible. 
* Those who do work put themselves and their families at risk of catching COVID-19. 
* Yet, those who do not have work -- due to lockdowns and lost jobs -- have nothing to eat. 

The BBC reports that somer residents are lining up <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56765150" target="blank">as early as 3 am</a> in the hopes of obtaining a meager amount of food assistance: "They are given a bowl of pasta with meat and a portion of rice, two packets of biscuits and a carton of milk, shared between a whole household and usually their only meal of the day."

The reporter quoted a mother whose family faces homelessness: "I was hoping for a good life," she says, fighting back tears.

Approximately 6% of Brazilian residents live in favelas, or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27635554" target="blank">over 11 million</a>. The BBC estimates that lockdowns and business failures have pushed an additional 9 million into poverty.

Brazil has been devastated by the COVID-19 outbreak, suffering the second highest number of deaths worldwide. A chronic lack of supplies, vaccines, and financial support for those affected has worsened the impact.

### Gerando Falcões

Students are asked to make a small donation if they like the course. All of the money raised goes to the favelas via a remarkable organization called Gerando Falcões ("Raising Falcons"). 

Founded by social entrepreneur <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/lacc/news/edu-lyra-of-gerando-falcoes-speaks-at-LSE" target="blank">Edu Lyra</a>, Gerando Falcões works in the streets of the favelas bringing education in entrepreneurship as well as sports and social engagement, along with direct humanitarian relief. The organization achieves impact by coordinating a network of NGOs to accelelerate progress.

(Even if you're not in the market for a language course, you can still donate.) 

## Digital food baskets
