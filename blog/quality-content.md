Many of the small businesses that have survived the pandemic lockdowns, have scaled staff back. Increasingly business owners are choosing to save money by doing more in house. 

If this is you, then you undoubtedly have to triage your time. If producing content is part of your strategy, then it will pay to understand the importance of quality content. This article is designed to provide a shortcut to that knowledge, by outlining the basics. 

## Quality is #1 

We can use common sense to arrive at a definition of quality content. But given that the quality of your content is paramount to Google, it makes sense to understand how Google defines quality.

Remember that the goal of quality content is to provide value to the user. This is Google's goal in its algorithms as well.


## It Takes Effort

In Google's words, "creating high quality MC [main content] takes a significant amount of at least one of the following: time, effort, expertise, and talent/skill."

Think about the articles on your website now. Do they manifest the above characteristics? 

Let's contrast those qualities with their opposite: 
* Plagiarized content
* Content that provides no clear value to the user
* Content that was thrown together with little thought
* Unsubstantiated claims, errors, or use of questionable sources
* Content that is disorganized, contains numerous typos, is formatted poorly, and needs editing

## Learning from Google’s Guidelines

Google uses human raters in addition to algorithms. The raters' assessments do not affect the ranking of content; they are used to assess how well the algorithms are engineered. However, reviewing the guidelines used by the raters -- <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf" target="blank">a 175-page document</a> -- even very briefly, provides clear cues as to what Google considers to be high quality or low quality content. 

Here are some sample descriptions of web pages that deserve a "low" ranking: 
* “the writing has frequent misspellings, typos, and grammar errors”
* "garbled information and a lack of editing: Both of these characteristics in combination justify the Lowest+ to Low rating."
* "contains mostly commonly known information and poor quality writing"
* "The article fails to cite sources"
* "The title of the article is misleading"
* "The writing of this article is unprofessional, including many grammar and punctuation errors"
* "appears to have been paraphrased from a science article found on a different source"
* "copied content with little or no time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or added value for users"

Here are some quotes from the guide on high quality content: 
* "original, accurate, comprehensive, clearly communicated, professionally presented"
* "This is a highly reputable charity according to multiple charity rating organizations. "

Medium quality is described as "Nothing wrong, but nothing special."

## Takeaways

* Quality trumps quantity every time.
* Identify any pages on your site that might require improvement and create a process for that.
* Ignore spurious ideas like "Every article has to be 2,000 words to rank well." Instead of focusing on word count, focus on providing the maximum value you can on the topic you've chosen. 

### Formatting and Order

Read Jakob Nielsen's groundbreaking research on <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/" target="blank">How Users Read on the Web</a>. The summary? "They don't. People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page . . . "  Nielsen's site offers tips on how to format your page to communicate effectively.

This research was conducted in 1997 but subsequent research has repeatedly arrived at the same conclusion. 

#### Logical Order

Creating a logical order in your article helps your user. Using h-tags for headlines and sub-headlines helps Google understand the structure of your page.

* Learn about the use of h-tags and use appropriate sub-headlines 
* Learn good headline practices
* Learn how to create a good meta-description 

## Summary

These simple actions are the unsexy fundamentals. And they should be diligently followed whenever you create and post an article. 

Many website owners skip over the unsexy fundamentals. That provides an opportunity for you.
